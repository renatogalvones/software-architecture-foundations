# Software Architecture Foundations

My notes about Linked Learning Course [Software Architecture Foundations](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/software-architecture-foundations/microkernel-plugin-architecture)



## Good Architecture
 - Simplicity
 - Maintainbility
 - Testability
 - Focused on the users not in the technology
 
 ## Domain Driven Design (DDD)
  - Ubiquitous language
  - Bounded Context
  
 ### Create Stories
  - Never technical
  - Vertical narrowing (fluxogram)
  - Workflow isolation
  - Identify agents in the system
  - Event storming
  - Define entities
  
 ### Design Patterns
 #### Monolyth
 
 #### Plug in <-> Microkernel
  - Strengths
  - - Isolation prevents big ball of mud dependencies
  - - Plugins are small and easy to write, debug, maintain
